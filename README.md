# How to Run the Project


First, you need to install all the dependencies of back-end found inside Pipfile.
Then just start your back-end server with the following command inside the app/backend folder:

    python __init__.py

Now you are able to user all routes found in http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs .

After that, you need to insert all the first generation pokemons inside your local database with the URL "/generate_pokemons".

Then you are able to start your front-end server.
Go inside the app/frontend folder and type the following command:

    npm run start


Now you are able to verify the status of the project in your front-end's server.


Some pictures of the project(which still developing) may be found inside the pictures folder.
